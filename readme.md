## Limitations
- Only major cities are available currently.
- Only flights are available as mode of transportation due to lack of data  regarding bus or trains.
- Flights with stops do not have any indications in the flight picker page(yet). However, it can be easily known from the details of that flight.
- Getting hotel list relies on performing 3 API calls sequentially, reulting in HUUUUGE load time. Same case for itinerary generation.
